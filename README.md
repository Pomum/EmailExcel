# Read-Emails-Write-Excel
Used to read emails, and put them in excel. This is written for a very specialized purpose.

Used JExcelApi => http://jexcelapi.sourceforge.net/ <br/>
And Javamail => https://javamail.java.net/nonav/docs/api/  

You have to update the server mail information in the ReadMails class (for now).
